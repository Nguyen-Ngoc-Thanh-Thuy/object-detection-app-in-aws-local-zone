This section provides a comprehensive guide for setting up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) between an on-premises environment and an AWS Local Zone. Following these steps will ensure secure and efficient communication between our infrastructure and AWS services.

### Overview of deployment steps
The deployment process is divided into four main stages:
   - **Deploy an EC2 instance for VPN**: In the first step, we will deploy an EC2 instance that will act as an VPN gateway within the AWS Local Zone. This instance will enable secure communication between an on-premises network and AWS environment.
   - **Configure simulated on-premises VPN**: Next, we will configure a simulated VPN on an on-premises environment. This configuration will ensure that the on-premises network and the AWS Local Zoneâ€”can communicate seamlessly via the VPN tunnel.
   - **Install and configure our AWS Local Zone VPN using Openswan**: The third step involves installing and configuring the VPN software on the AWS Local Zone instance using Openswan, a popular open-source solution for IPsec VPNs. This configuration is critical for establishing a secure tunnel between the AWS Local Zone and your on-premises network.
   - **Update our extended VPC Route Table to use the VPN for accessing on-premises resources**: Finally, we will update the extended VPC route table in our AWS Local Zone to route traffic through the VPN, enabling AWS resources to access on-premises systems securely.
