# OBJECT DETECTION APPLICATION IN AWS LOCAL ZONE

üöÄ Deploying a low-latency object detection in AWS Local Zone for streaming video via Site-to-Site VPN using OpenSwan.

In this lab, we will deploy and configure a video streaming system from a virtual on-premises environment to a low-latency object detection application in AWS Local Zones via a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN connection using OpenSwan. 

We will practice steps including setting up the network resources in AWS, extending a VPC to an AWS Local Zone, deploying a VPN, streaming real-time video, and running an object detection application at the edge.

This lab helps us understand how to leverage AWS Local Zones to reduce latency in real-time applications while optimizing connectivity between on-premises environments and AWS.
